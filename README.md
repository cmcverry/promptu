Web URL: https://promptu-4f001.web.app/ <br/> APK Download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-yXQCcT44rMP3GYnsMD5rk5nwtjHyCeN/view?usp=sharing

Download the APK and install it on a physical android device or emulator, or visit the web URL with an internet browser.

On the landing page the app will take a moment to setup and assign the user with a randomly generated name.

On the prompts page a user can view the daily prompts and click/tap one to navigate to its discussion page.

On the topic page a user can click the 'comment' button to create and submit their own comment. Comments can be freely downvoted/upvoted; however, a user can only downvote/upvote each comment once. Users can award 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' badges to comment (limited to one comment per discussion prompt). There are also 'fire' and 'downtrend' badges that are automatically awarded to comments based on recent upvote/downvote history.
